Festers . Everywhere . Armed mostly with gas-powered rock flingers .
At least 10 of them gaurding the hangar door . Typical.

Could try punching my way through . Or Sneaking the long way to the 
amergency exit.

What should I do?
1. Take them head on - rush the 10 gaurds.
2. Sneak my way on the emergency exit.
